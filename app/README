##PLANET
Welcome to PLANet a scheduling library to help you find time to complete all your tasks.

How to use:
1. Clone git repo.
2. Run the library and copy the created aar file from the generated folder.
3. Paste the aar file into libs folder of your app.
4. Add the following line to your module's gradle file:
   In dependencies : implementation(name: 'library-debug', ext: 'aar')
   In repositories : flatDir {
                             dirs 'libs'
                         }
5. Add the following permissions to your AndroidManifest:
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_CALENDAR" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR" />

To add a new calendar just use our preCreated PlannerMediator, which can be synced with
google calendar automatically, or insert events manually, as specified during creation.

To add a new task and watch our sub task creation algorithm at play, use PlannerMediator's addTask,
and specify the task's deadline and expected duration it will take to complete in milliseconds.
